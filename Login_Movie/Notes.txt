  Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

  App

     Button ==> +1 | -1
     Display

  Step 2: Build A Static Version in React   

  Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State


           Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn't state.
           Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn't state.
           Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn't state.

           e.g

            state ==> count  

  Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live 

           e.g AppComponent shud hold count state
